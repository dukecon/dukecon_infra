= Infrastructure Dukecon

== Overview

Dukecon Server is just a Spring Boot app which can be started with `java -jar ...`. But integration of database, security, etc. needs a more complicated setup. The goal of this document is to describe the whole Dukecon infrastructure and the interaction between its building blocks and tools.

Configuration and initial setup of Dukecon infrastructure can be found here: https://github.com/dukecon/dukecon_infra
